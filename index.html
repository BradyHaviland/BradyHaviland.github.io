    <p>Hello! My name is Brady Haviland, I'm majoring in Web and User Experience, minoring in Business Administration and my concentration is in User Experience Design. I have changed my 
        major four times, so I don't really know if I'll stick with this either. Though I am figuring out what I want to do nonetheless. This site is a portfolio of my works in WEB 1430. When I am
        not worrying about school or doing homework, I enjoy going to the gym and weightlifting, doing aerial silks, tumbling, and pole fitness. I also love making and playing
        board games, I hope to have a board game company someday. And I think this degree will help me with that. </p>
